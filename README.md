# House-Price-Analysis-and-Prediction
Analyze a dataset of house prices to understand pricing factors, identify outliers, and develop a model for future price prediction.
Tasks:
1. Data Cleaning and Exploration:
o Clean the data: Identify and handle missing values, inconsistencies,
and outliers.
o Explore the data: Analyze the distribution of house prices and other
features. Identify potential relationships between features and price
using visualizations (scatter plots, box plots, etc.).
2. Feature Engineering:
o Create new features that might be relevant for price prediction (e.g.,
age of the house, number of bedrooms per floor).
o Consider encoding categorical features (e.g., location) into numerical
values suitable for modeling.
3. Outlier Analysis:
o Identify houses with significantly higher or lower prices compared to
similar properties.
o Investigate the reasons for these outliers. Are there any specific
features or combinations of features that contribute to the outliers?
4. Predictive Modeling:
o Train a machine learning model to predict house prices based on the
available features. Popular choices for this task include linear
regression, random forest, or gradient boosting.
o Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics (e.g.,
mean squared error, R-squared).
5. Future Price Prediction:
o Use the trained model to predict future house prices based on
hypothetical scenarios (e.g., what would be the price of a house with
specific characteristics in a particular location?).
6. Report and Recommendations:
o Prepare a report summarizing your findings, including:
▪ Data exploration results (key insights from visualizations)
▪ Feature engineering techniques used
▪ Outlier analysis (identification and explanation)
▪ Model selection and evaluation results
▪ Future price prediction examples
▪ Recommendations for further analysis or data collection (if
applicable)
